DONE - Refactored into classes
DONE - Make it so we can add sprites
DONE - Need a data structure to keep track of all the sprites and the video
DONE - Create editable text
DONE - Remove focus highlight
DONE - Savable and loadable format
DONE - Use a regex to parse the transform instead of a matrix, because it can't do multiple rotations!
DONE - Need to make the widgets as if they are inside the video, and need to scale the video to the min dimension of the screen
DONE - Code that copies a frame of the video so that the html2canvas code works
DONE - Get canvas rendering because we know it's all consistent
DONE - Get the text working with the animations, maybe need an animation event again like we had before (set value)
DONE - Bug where we can't create new elements after loading (id conflict) use a guid for ids or something
DONE - Concept of a selection, which widget we last clicked on
DONE - Draw video and sprites to canvas
DONE - Choose a framerate and play through each image, saving each into a png
DONE - Encode canvas into video (mp4/webm)
DONE - Touch does not capture on timeline (mobile)
DONE - Make the ui more functional (icons, right top aligned, responsive to size changes, etc.)
DONE - Get it built on travis-ci
DONE - Get it deployed to github pages
DONE - Move video controls and buttons to another div that doesn't get captured with html2canvas
DONE - Add modal for saving and loading
DONE - Add modal for rendering animation
DONE - Install font-awesome locally instead of using a CDN
DONE - Rendering of widgets seems to be slightly off in encoded video...
DONE - Widget already exists bug
DONE - CORS error because videoSrc has full path (https)
DONE - Add cancel button for modals that take time
DONE - Selection that doesn't rely on focus so we can click buttons (can get rid of focus hack too)
DONE - Motion tracking
DONE - To do motion, we select a single sprite and then click the motion button
DONE - From the current point in the video, wherever the sprite is located, it will attempt to track it until you click stop
DONE - So we'll play the video at half speed or so so you can respond to it
DONE - This should make a continuous animation (something we can make as a concept on the timeline)
DONE - Make our own timeline for the video/scene
DONE - Play/pause button
DONE - Scrub timeline (capture mouse)
DONE - Play pause button does not update if video changed state externally (e.g. play() pause())
DONE - Gizmos create keyframes every time we select
DONE - Changing selected widget does not update timeline keyframes
DONE - Can't delete widgets anymore
DONE - Draw all widgets using canvas
DONE - Make transparent images and overlay them using ffmpeg (without capturing video snapshots)
DONE - Dramatically speed up rendering by not using html2canvas
DONE - Directly run scenejs/timline from the renderer
DONE - Hide video during canvas rendering
DONE - Properly pack/serve ffmpeg worker, don't use https://unpkg.com/@ffmpeg/ffmpeg@v0.5.2/dist/worker.min.js
DONE - Make text via a modal text input (doesn't change, use svg)
DONE - Fix text rendering
DONE - Tabbing away from video as it's encoding messes it up (can just say don't tab away for now)

 - Make a PR to allow searching stickers (checkbox for stickers)
 - Double click or double tap or tap + hold actions to change text or image
 - Tweak ffmpeg settings to encode faster
 - Android ffmpeg encoding doesn't seem to run
 - Upload videos or sprites
 - Timeline view that lets us delete frames / seek to frames, even if it's minimal
 - Can't scale and rotate on mobile easily (both fingers need to be on sprite)
 - Button to hide/show sprites on specific frames (show as transparent while editing)
 - Make the manager create the container and widget container (pass in body)
 - Add delete button (trash) and visual feedback, for mobile
 - Add full screen loading animation for blocking operations

 - Usage ajv and typescript schemas or something similar to validate searialized json data (client loading and server)
 - Scenejs Keyframe bug where it doesn't seek correctly: min repro and report it

 - Import main video from disk
 - Import sprite from disk

 - Hire animators and meme creators to create stupid meme content

 - Facial recognition
 - Green screening

 - Import main video from giphy
 - Import main video from youtube?
 - Import sprite from giphy

 - Encode canvas into gif

 - Share on giphy, imgur, etc.

Sound (postponed):
 - Use media scene and change to playing the scenejs rather than seeking it on every video frame
 - Individual audio elements need to seek properly
 - Use media scene delay to set audio start time
 - Create sound object
 - Play sounds as we seek / animate
 - Import sound from disk
 - Sound from "text to speech"
 - Import sound from some other sound service
