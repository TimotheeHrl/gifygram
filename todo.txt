DONE - Refactored into classes
DONE - Make it so we can add sprites
DONE - Need a data structure to keep track of all the sprites and the video
DONE - Create editable text
DONE - Remove focus highlight
DONE - Savable and loadable format
DONE - Use a regex to parse the transform instead of a matrix, because it can't do multiple rotations!
DONE - Need to make the widgets as if they are inside the video, and need to scale the video to the min dimension of the screen
DONE - Code that copies a frame of the video so that the html2canvas code works
DONE - Get canvas rendering because we know it's all consistent
DONE - Get the text working with the animations, maybe need an animation event again like we had before (set value)

Bug where we can't create new elements after loading (id conflict)
 - use a guid for ids or something


 - Usage ajv and typescript schemas or something similar to validate searialized json data (client loading and server)
We could attempt to use media scene, but then the problem will probably be that we are
seeking the scene rather than playing it, so we'll have to play the scene simultaneously with the video

Keyframe bug where it doesn't seek correctly
 - Make a min repro and report it

If we want media to work, we'll probably have to use mediajs
 - Because the individual audio elements need to seek properly
 - Need to set a delay I guess then
 - Kinda sucks, I didn't want to have a separate interface for audio

 - Make our own timeline for the video/scene
   - Play/pause button
   - Scrub timeline (capture mouse)

 - Timeline view that lets us delete frames / seek to frames, even if it's minimal
 - Create sound object
 - Change text as we seek / animate
 - Play sounds as we seek / animate
 - Concept of a selection, which widget we last clicked on

 - Import main video from disk
 - Import sprite from disk
 - Import sound from disk

 - Hire animators and meme creators to create stupid meme content

 - Facial recognition
 - Motion tracking
 - Green screening
 - Sound from "text to speech"

 - Import main video from giphy
 - Import main video from youtube?
 - Import sprite from giphy
 - Import sound from some other sound service

 - Draw video and sprites to canvas
 - Encode canvas into video (mp4/webm)
 - Encode canvas into gif

 - Share on giphy, imgur, etc.
